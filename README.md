# Etch-A-Sketch
browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.
In this project I will use my DOM manipulation skills.

Things I learned in this project:

1-I learned Document Object Model manipulation which can make the project more interactive and helped me make the grid with few lines of code that made a lot of divs (Squares in the board) which would've been much harder if i didnt use the DOM (creating the divs manually).

2-I do know flex-box, but in this project i used css grid because the drawing board worked better using grid (when i use flexbox it makes unnecessary empty spaces and margins around the smaller squares) + *i should learn more about grid because i didnt fully understand it :).

3-Learned how to use color picker and read its value.

4-Learned how to use the size slider and make its value affect the board size.

5-Learned few things about toggle switches.

This project took me about 5 hours ⌚
